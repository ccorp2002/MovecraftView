# PHP-CraftType-Viewer
A Movecraft Vehicle/CraftType file Viewer. Resurrected from: https://github.com/mwkaicz/MovecraftView

# Suggested Usage
Also keep in mind it does *NOT* parse/read Minecraft Tags what-so-ever;
If you want to display a craft using all different types of Wool/Planks/Whatever:
Rather than `"#minecraft:wool"` or `"#glazed_terracotta"`, write `"All Wool Colors"` or `"All Glazed Terracotta"` for User-Readability.
(Keep versions of In-game craft files separate from the Website/User Read versions too!)
